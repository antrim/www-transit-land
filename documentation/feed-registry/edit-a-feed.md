1. In the [Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/), click the link in the Operator Name column for the feed you want to update.
2. In the Feed Details section, copy the URL for the feed's data location.
2. Navigate to [https://transit.land/feed-registry/feeds/new](https://transit.land/feed-registry/feeds/new).
3. Paste the feed's URL into the text box.
4. Click Next.
5. If a matching operator is found, you see a notification that you are in a mode where you can edit a feed. If no existing operators are found, you are adding the feed. 
6. Modify only the details you want to change about the feed. 
7. Submit the feed.
