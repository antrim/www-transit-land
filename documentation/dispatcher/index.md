Transitland Dispatcher is an interface used to administer the Transitland Datastore, review and apply changesets, and monitor feed fetching and importing.

Anyone can view the Dispatcher, but to edit changesets and trigger feed imports requires administrative credentials. (Note, administrative credentials are also required to view the names and e-mail addresses of contributors.) For the time being, only Mapzen staff have these credentials. Over time, the aim is to share oversight of the Datastore with more participants.

## About the Dispatcher application

The Dispatcher is written in JavaScript using the [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com) framework. View Dispatcher code and report bugs [on GitHub](http://github.com/transitland/dispatcher).
