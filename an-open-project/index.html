        Transitland is an "open" project. That's a vague and overused word&mdash;still, "open" is a great goal.
      </p>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>Transitland is built using exclusively open-source software. When possible, we release new tools under flexible licenses like MIT that allow use in both non-commercial and commercial settings.</p>
      <h3>Data</h3>
      <p>Data in the Onestop and Transitland systems are covered by a variety of terms and licenses. Unless otherwise indicated, original data in the <a href="https://github.com/transitland/onestop-id-registry/">Onestop ID Registry</a> and the Transitland Datastore are made available under the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/summary/">Public Domain Dedication and License v1.0</a>. By opening a pull request or contribute a changeset, you consent to release your contributions under these license terms as well.</p>
      <p>GTFS feeds and other data from authoritative sources are covered by their own licenses and terms of service. We're working to standardize this maze of licenses, but in the meantime, we ask you to review each license individually, in the context of your application.</p>
      <h3>Direction</h3>
      <p>Transitland is sponsored by <a href="https://mapzen.com/">Mapzen</a>. It's staff employed at Mapzen who have created Transitland and are setting its direction. We welcome partners who would like to be involved in Transitland, especially those who care about technical nuts-and-bolts and those who care about building a system that's useful for enthusiasts and non-experts.</p>
      <p>There are already venues for negotiating data-interoperability specifications and debating general transit / transportation / planning topics. The point of Transitland is to create transit data services that work&mdash;even if they're not perfect be-all-end-alls.</p>
